# Election-Audit Summary
Our script has successfully allowed us to present the desirable data for the election commission. Due to the fact that we used Python and its tools to create it, we are now able to use the exact same script for any other election in the future - whether we have 3 candidates running or 10, whether we have 3 counties or 20 - our script can easily be used for any election (thanks to loops it will all happen automatically). 
Not only can we use the script for our own purposes in the future, we can also sell it to others - considreing that the election process is preeety much identical everywhere.
